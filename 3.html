  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup langguage for
  <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. Web browsers
  receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into
  multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
  and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML
  pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive
  forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create
  structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
  paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated
  by tags, written using angle brackets.
